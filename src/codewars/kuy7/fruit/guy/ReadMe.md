<h2>7 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>Our fruit guy has a bag of fruit (represented as an array of strings) where some fruits are rotten. 
He wants to replace all the rotten pieces of fruit with fresh ones. 
For example, given <code>["apple","rottenBanana","apple"]</code> 
the replaced array should be <code>["apple","banana","apple"]</code>.<br>
Your task is to implement a method that accepts an array of strings 
containing fruits should returns an array of strings where all the rotten fruits 
are replaced by good ones.</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the array is <code>null</code> or empty you should return empty array <code>([])</code>.</li>
<li>The rotten fruit name will be in this camelcase <code>(rottenFruit)</code>.</li>
<li>The returned array should be in lowercase.</li>
</ul>
