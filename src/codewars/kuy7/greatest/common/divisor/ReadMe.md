<h2>7 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.</p>
<p>The inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are always greater or equal to 1, 
so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.</p>
