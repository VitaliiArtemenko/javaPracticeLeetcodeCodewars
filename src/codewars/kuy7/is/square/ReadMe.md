<h3>A square of squares</h3>
<p>You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. 
And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!</p>
<p>However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! 
Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ 
Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Given an integral number, determine if it's a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">square number</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>In mathematics, a <strong>square number</strong> or <strong>perfect square</strong> is an integer 
that is the square of an integer; 
in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
</pre>
