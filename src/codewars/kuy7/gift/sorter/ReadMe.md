<p>Santa's senior gift organizer Elf developed a way to represent up to 26 gifts by assigning 
a unique alphabetical character to each gift. After each gift was assigned a character, 
the gift organizer Elf then joined the characters to form the gift ordering code.</p>
<p>Santa asked his organizer to order the characters in alphabetical order, but the Elf fell asleep 
from consuming too much hot chocolate and candy canes! Can you help him out?</p>
<h3>Sort the Gift Code</h3>
<p>Write a function called <code>sortGiftCode</code> that accepts a string 
containing up to 26 unique alphabetical characters, 
and returns a string containing the same characters in alphabetical order.</p>
<p><strong>Examples (Input -- => Output):</strong></p>
<pre>
"abcdef"                      -- => "abcdef"
"pqksuvy"                     -- => "kpqsuvy"
"zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"  -- => "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
</pre>
