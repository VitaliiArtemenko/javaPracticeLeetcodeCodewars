<h2>6 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. 
Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).</p>
<p>Return <code>null</code> if the input is an even number or negative, 
as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>A size 3 diamond:</p>
<pre>
 *
***
 *
</pre>
<p>...which would appear as a string of <code>" *\n***\n *\n"</code></p>
<p>A size 5 diamond:</p>
<pre>
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
</pre>
<p>...that is:</p>
<pre>
"  *\n ***\n*****\n ***\n  *\n"
</pre>
