<h2>6 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
<p>Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. 
Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the number is a multiple of <strong>both</strong> 3 and 5, only count it once.</p>
