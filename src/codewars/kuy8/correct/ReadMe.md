<hr>
<p>Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. 
Thus, the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.</p>
<p>When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), 
are digitised character recognition pieces of software often make mistakes.</p>
<p>Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. 
You only have to handle the following mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>S</code> is misinterpreted as <code>5</code></li>
<li><code>O</code> is misinterpreted as <code>0</code></li>
<li><code>I</code> is misinterpreted as <code>1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.</p>
