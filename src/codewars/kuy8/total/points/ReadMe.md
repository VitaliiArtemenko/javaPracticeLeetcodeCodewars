<hr>
<p>Our football team finished the championship. 
The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.</p>
<p>For example: <code>["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]</code></p>
<p>Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. 
Rules for counting points for each match:</p>
<ul>
<li>if x > y - 3 points</li>
<li>if x < y - 0 point</li>
<li>if x = y - 1 point</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>there are 10 matches in the championship</li>
<li>0 <= x <= 4</li>
<li>0 <= y <= 4</li>
</ul>
